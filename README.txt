Aumit Leon - Sudoku Solver

UPDATES 7/8-- 
	- Shifted strategy-- no longer attempting to generate my own Sudoku Board, have instead developed a way to input a board through a standard text file. 
	- getHeight() and getWidth() added, so users can automatically get the height and width of the sudoku board, which can be modified within the header file. 
	- input() function takes the proper position in the box and inputs the proper number. 

Current State 7/8-- 
There is a file in the directory titled "board.txt" which is where users can input the board that will be used. Each line represents each column. The proper number is put in it's order, and empty spaces are filled with a 0. See the current board.txt file to see how users can input boards. 
Ex: 006040800
